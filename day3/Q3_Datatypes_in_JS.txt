1.Number-
Number will represent integer and floating numbers.
let num=345;

2.String
A string in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes.
let str = "Hello";

3.Boolean (logical type)
The boolean type has only two values: true and false.
This type is commonly used to store yes/no values: true means “yes, correct”, and false means “no, incorrect”.

e.g
let isGreater = 4 > 1;

alert( isGreater ); // true (the comparison result is "yes")

4.The “null” value
The special null value does not belong to any of the types described above.
It forms a separate type of its own which contains only the null value:

let age = null;

5.The “undefined” value
The special value undefined also stands apart. It makes a type of its own, just like null.
The meaning of undefined is “value is not assigned”.
If a variable is declared, but not assigned, then its value is undefined
:
let age;
alert(age);

6.Object
object for more complex data structures.

7.Symbol
symbol for unique identifiers.
